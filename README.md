# Carabiner Actions

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions for various tools in the
Carabiner ecosystem. These actions help streamline security policy verification,
attestation management, and supply chain security workflows.

## Actions

### login

The `login` action exchanges the workflow's GitHub OIDC identity for a
short-lived Carabiner token via the Carabiner token exchange server
(`auth.carabiner.dev` by default). The token is masked and exported as the
`CARABINER_CREDENTIALS` environment variable so later steps and Carabiner tools
can use it.

The exchange only succeeds when the repository's GitHub organization is claimed
as a namespace by a Carabiner organization **and** the repository has a
monitored pipeline; otherwise no token is issued. The issued token's lifetime is
paired to the workflow's OIDC token.

#### Usage

The calling job must grant `id-token: write` so the action can mint a workflow
OIDC token:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write   # required to mint the workflow OIDC token
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: carabiner-dev/actions/login@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8 # pin to a release commit once tagged
      # CARABINER_CREDENTIALS is now set for subsequent steps
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `exchange-url` | No | `https://auth.carabiner.dev` | Base URL of the Carabiner token exchange server. The workflow OIDC token is minted for this audience. |
| `audience` | No | `https://api.carabiner.dev` | Audience (a Carabiner service URL) to request the token for. |
| `scope` | No | `attestations:read attestations:write` | Space-separated capability scopes to request. The issued token carries the intersection of the requested and granted scopes; set empty for an identity-only token. |

#### Outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `expires-in` | Lifetime of the issued Carabiner token, in seconds. |
| `scope` | Space-separated scopes granted on the issued token (may be empty). |

See the [login README](login/README.md) for the full flow, security notes, and
troubleshooting.

### ampel/verify

The `ampel/verify` action verifies a subject (file or hash) against a security
policy using the 🔴🟡🟢 AMPEL supply chain policy engine. This action evaluates
whether a given artifact meets your defined security requirements by analyzing
its attestations against a policy.

#### Usage

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8
  with:
    policy: 'path/to/policy.yaml'   # URI or path to policy code
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'     # or digest, eg sha256:98349875bf3e09...
    collector: 'github'             # Collectors used to retrieve attestations
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `policy` | Yes | - | Path to the security policy file to evaluate against |
| `subject` | Yes | - | Path to a file or hash (algo:value) to use as verification subject |
| `collector` | Yes | - | Collector to load to read attestations (e.g., 'jsonl', 'github', 'coci', etc) |
| `attest` | No | `true` | Attest the policy evaluation results |
| `attest-format` | No | `ampel` | Format of the results attestation |
| `results-path` | No | `ampel.intoto.json` | Path to store the results attestation |
| `push-attestation` | No | `false` | Pushes the attestation to the GitHub attestations store |
| `attestation` | No | `""` | Comma separated list of additional attestations to ingest |
| `signer` | No | `""` | Comma separated list of expected signer identity slugs |
| `key` | No | `""` | Path to a key file to use for verification |
| `keydata` | No | `""` | Raw key material to use for verification |
| `fail` | No | `true` | Fail the workflow if the policy fails |

#### Examples

**Basic verification:**

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/binary'
    collector: 'github'
```

**Verification with custom attestations:**

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'sha256:abc123...'
    collector: 'oci'
    attestation: 'sbom.json,provenance.json'
    signer: 'github-actions,my-org'
```

**Verification with attestation push:**

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'
    collector: 'github'
    attest: 'true'
    push-attestation: 'true'
    results-path: 'verification-results.json'
```

**Verification without failing the workflow:**

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'
    collector: 'github'
    fail: 'false'
```

### sbom/source

The `sbom/source` action generates SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) for all
codebases discovered by [unpack](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/unpack) in the
repository source. It supports SPDX and CycloneDX formats and can filter by
ecosystem or specific codebase IDs.

> This action used to live at `unpack/sbom`. That path still works but is
> deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

#### Usage

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/sbom/source@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8
  with:
    ecosystems: |
      golang
      npm
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `codebases` | No | `""` | Newline-separated list of codebase IDs to generate SBOMs for |
| `ecosystems` | No | `""` | Newline-separated list of ecosystems to include |
| `ignore` | No | `""` | Newline-separated list of path patterns to ignore |
| `files` | No | `false` | Include file information in generated SBOMs |
| `format` | No | `spdx` | SBOM format: `spdx` or `cyclonedx` |
| `output-path` | No | `.` | Directory to write SBOMs to |

See the [sbom/source README](sbom/source/README.md) for full documentation,
filename conventions, and more examples.

### sbom/image

The `sbom/image` action generates SBOMs of container images with
[unpack](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/unpack). It pulls each image, squashes
its layers and extracts the operating system packages installed in it (apk, dpkg
and rpm, including distroless images). The resulting SBOMs can be wrapped in
in-toto attestations and signed with the workflow's own identity.

#### Usage

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/sbom/image@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8
  with:
    images: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
    attest: 'true'
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `images` | Yes | - | Newline-separated list of OCI references to generate SBOMs for |
| `files` | No | `false` | Include the package file lists in the generated SBOMs |
| `format` | No | `spdx` | SBOM format: `spdx` or `cyclonedx` |
| `attest` | No | `false` | Wrap the generated SBOMs in in-toto attestations |
| `sign` | No | `false` | Sign the attestations into sigstore bundles (implies `attest`) |
| `output-path` | No | `""` | Directory to write SBOMs to |
| `push-to-release` | No | `""` | Upload the generated SBOMs to the GitHub release matching this tag |
| `unpack-version` | No | `""` | Version of unpack to install; must be v0.3.1 or newer |

Signing requires the job to grant `id-token: write`.

See the [sbom/image README](sbom/image/README.md) for full documentation,
filename conventions, private registry notes, and more examples.
