# Carabiner Actions

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions for various tools in the
Carabiner ecosystem. These actions help streamline security policy verification,
attestation management, and supply chain security workflows.

## Actions

### ampel/verify

The `ampel/verify` action verifies a subject (file or hash) against a security
policy using the 🔴🟡🟢 AMPEL supply chain policy engine. This action evaluates
whether a given artifact meets your defined security requirements by analyzing
its attestations against a policy.

#### Usage

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@e0e3b8149dafed833431095bc148d50e7eade4e8 # v1.2.0
  with:
    policy: 'path/to/policy.yaml'   # URI or path to policy code
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'     # or digest, eg sha256:98349875bf3e09...
    collector: 'github'             # Collectors used to retrieve attestations
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `policy` | Yes | - | Path to the security policy file to evaluate against |
| `subject` | Yes | - | Path to a file or hash (algo:value) to use as verification subject |
| `collector` | Yes | - | Collector to load to read attestations (e.g., 'jsonl', 'github', 'coci', etc) |
| `attest` | No | `true` | Attest the policy evaluation results |
| `attest-format` | No | `ampel` | Format of the results attestation |
| `results-path` | No | `ampel.intoto.json` | Path to store the results attestation |
| `push-attestation` | No | `false` | Pushes the attestation to the GitHub attestations store |
| `attestation` | No | `""` | Comma separated list of additional attestations to ingest |
| `signer` | No | `""` | Comma separated list of expected signer identity slugs |
| `key` | No | `""` | Path to a key file to use for verification |
| `keydata` | No | `""` | Raw key material to use for verification |
| `fail` | No | `true` | Fail the workflow if the policy fails |

#### Examples

**Basic verification:**

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@e0e3b8149dafed833431095bc148d50e7eade4e8 # v1.2.0
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/binary'
    collector: 'github'
```

**Verification with custom attestations:**

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@e0e3b8149dafed833431095bc148d50e7eade4e8 # v1.2.0
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'sha256:abc123...'
    collector: 'oci'
    attestation: 'sbom.json,provenance.json'
    signer: 'github-actions,my-org'
```

**Verification with attestation push:**

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@e0e3b8149dafed833431095bc148d50e7eade4e8 # v1.2.0
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'
    collector: 'github'
    attest: 'true'
    push-attestation: 'true'
    results-path: 'verification-results.json'
```

**Verification without failing the workflow:**

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/ampel/verify@e0e3b8149dafed833431095bc148d50e7eade4e8 # v1.2.0
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'
    collector: 'github'
    fail: 'false'
```

### unpack/sbom

The `unpack/sbom` action generates SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) for all
codebases discovered by [unpack](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/unpack). It
supports SPDX and CycloneDX formats and can filter by ecosystem or specific
codebase IDs.

#### Usage

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/unpack/sbom@e0e3b8149dafed833431095bc148d50e7eade4e8 # v1.2.0
  with:
    ecosystems: |
      golang
      npm
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `codebases` | No | `""` | Newline-separated list of codebase IDs to generate SBOMs for |
| `ecosystems` | No | `""` | Newline-separated list of ecosystems to include |
| `ignore` | No | `""` | Newline-separated list of path patterns to ignore |
| `files` | No | `false` | Include file information in generated SBOMs |
| `format` | No | `spdx` | SBOM format: `spdx` or `cyclonedx` |
| `output-path` | No | `.` | Directory to write SBOMs to |

See the [unpack/sbom README](unpack/sbom/README.md) for full documentation,
filename conventions, and more examples.

### Go Actions
