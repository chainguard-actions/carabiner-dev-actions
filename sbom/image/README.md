# sbom/image

A reusable GitHub Action that generates SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) of
container images using [unpack](https://github.com/carabiner-dev/unpack).

The action runs `unpack image` for each reference it is given: the image is
pulled, its layers are squashed into the filesystem a running container would
see, and the operating system packages installed in it (apk, dpkg and rpm
databases, including distroless images) are extracted into an SPDX or CycloneDX
SBOM. Multi-arch references produce a single SBOM with the index at the top and
one node per platform image, each carrying its own packages.

The SBOMs can optionally be wrapped in in-toto attestations and signed into
sigstore bundles using the workflow's own identity, which is what makes the
action useful right after an image build step in CI.

> [!NOTE]
> Image extraction landed in unpack v0.3.1, which is the version
> [`install/unpack`](../../install/unpack) installs by default. The
> `unpack-version` input overrides it with any newer release.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: carabiner-dev/actions/sbom/image@5c3fc97584f8e39921fcfefe319a60f0657294a0 # v1.2.8
  with:
    images: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.ref_name }}
```

With no other inputs, the action will:

1. Install `unpack` into the runner
2. Pull each image and extract its installed packages
3. Write one SPDX SBOM per image to a temporary directory
4. Expose the generated paths through the `files` output

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `images` | Yes | - | Newline-separated list of OCI references to generate SBOMs for (e.g. `alpine:3.21`, `ghcr.io/org/app@sha256:...`). |
| `files` | No | `false` | Include the package file lists in the generated SBOMs. |
| `format` | No | `spdx3` | SBOM format: `spdx` (SPDX 2.3), `spdx3` (SPDX 3.0.1) or `cyclonedx` (also accepts `cdx`). |
| `attest` | No | `false` | Wrap the generated SBOMs in in-toto attestations. |
| `sign` | No | `false` | Sign the attestations into sigstore bundles (implies `attest`). |
| `output-path` | No | `""` | Directory where the generated SBOMs will be written. When empty, a temporary directory is created automatically. |
| `push-to-release` | No | `""` | When set, upload the generated SBOMs to the GitHub release matching this tag (e.g. `v1.2.3`). Requires `GH_TOKEN` to be set in the environment. |
| `unpack-version` | No | `""` | Version of unpack to install. Must be v0.3.1 or newer. When empty, the version pinned by `install/unpack` is used. |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `files` | Newline-separated list of generated SBOM file paths |

## Permissions

Signing uses the job's workload identity, so `sign: 'true'` requires the job to
grant `id-token: write`. The action fails early with a clear error when the
permission is missing.

When using `push-to-release`, the token set in `GH_TOKEN` must have
`contents: write` permission to upload assets to the GitHub release.

## Private registries

`unpack` resolves registry credentials through the standard Docker keychain, so
pulling from a private registry only requires logging in before this action
runs, for example with `docker/login-action`. Public images need no
authentication.

## Filename Convention

One file is written per image reference. The reference is sanitized into the
filename by replacing every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` with a dash and
collapsing repeated dashes:

```
{sanitized-image-reference}.spdx.json
```

The extension reflects what was requested:

| Inputs | Extension |
| --- | --- |
| default | `.spdx.json` |
| `attest: 'true'` | `.spdx.intoto.json` |
| `sign: 'true'` | `.spdx.bundle.json` |

The table shows the `spdx` format; `spdx3` and the CycloneDX format replace
`spdx` with `spdx3` and `cdx` respectively in all of the above.

**Examples:**

| Image reference | Filename |
| --- | --- |
| `alpine:3.21` | `alpine-3.21.spdx.json` |
| `ghcr.io/carabiner-dev/unpack:v0.2.1` | `ghcr.io-carabiner-dev-unpack-v0.2.1.spdx.json` |
| `ghcr.io/org/app@sha256:abc123` | `ghcr.io-org-app-sha256-abc123.spdx.json` |

References that sanitize to the same name overwrite each other; the action
warns when it replaces a file that already exists.

## Examples
